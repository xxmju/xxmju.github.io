## Website under construction!

### Hi! My name is Maggie and I am a first-year Physics PhD student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, advised by Prof. Melinda Soares-Furtado. Currently, I study dipper stars (a type of variable star) in the Orion Nebula Cluster using JWST NIRCam data.

### I graduated with my B.S. in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Rochester in 2025.
